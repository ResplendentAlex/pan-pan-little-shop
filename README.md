# pan-pan-little-shop

## üìÉ **DESCRIPTION**<br>
This web application is a trading hub, specifically for art and crafts. It is made specifically for one of my college projects, PBP (Programming Berbasis Platform).


## ‚öôÔ∏è **USAGE**<br>
You can access the live web application directly from the link below:
[LINK TO WEBPAGE](http://alexander-william-panpanlittleshop.pbp.cs.ui.ac.id/)

If you prefer to open it locally, however, simply clone this repository into your local folder. Make sure to install the requirements using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Without doing so, the Django module would not be detected and the web application would not launch.


## üõ†Ô∏è **CONTRIBUTION**<br>
If you wish to contribute to this project, you can clone the project directly and edit it with any code editor to your liking, assuming that you have Django already setup. If not, you should first get Django installed into your device before proceeding as the application is fully developed within the Django framework.<br>
