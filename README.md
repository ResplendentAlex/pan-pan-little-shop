# pan-pan-little-shop

## **DESCRIPTION**<br>
This web application is a trading hub, specifically for art and crafts.<br>
It is made specifically for one of my college projects, PBP (Programming Berbasis Platform).


## **USAGE**<br>
You can access the live web application directly from the link below:<br>
[LINK TO WEBPAGE](http://alexander-william-panpanlittleshop.pbp.cs.ui.ac.id/)<br>

If you prefer to open it locally, however, simply clone this repository into your local<br>
folder. Make sure to install the requirements using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>
Without doing so, the Django module would not be detected.


## **CONTRIBUTION**<br>
If you wish to contribute to this project, you must first have the Django framework installed into your device. This is because 
the application is fully developed with the Django framework.
